0 This is simultaneously the README *AND* the database!
1 (If you actually care about this README, copy it outside of the server's directory)
2 This database is incredibly simple.
3 Really, it's just a network shared array
4 Maybe queue is a better word?
5 Anyways. The way it works is this:
6 At any time, any client can request "the data"
7 Then this whole file gets served up!
8 Also, any client can request to "write" to "the database"
9 This will result in a line being added with the data the client intended to write!
10 <- You've probably noticed the numbers to the left
11 Every time data is written, and a line is added, it gets prefixed by the next increment in line number (followed by one space)
12 But to prevent "the database" from getting too big, the first line in this fil- er, "the database" gets cut!
13 "But doesn't that result in loss of data?!?!"
14 Yes. If you care about your data why in the hell are you using this database...
15 Anyways...
16 The idea is that any client keeps a local composition of all the data it knows about, using the line numbers to help with the merge
17 And relies on its own spec to sift through what data it actually cares about "I'll prefix it with X", etc...
18 So, just to be clear:
19 ALL DATA IS INCREDIBLY OBVIOUSLY PUBLIC, ALL THE TIME
20 ALL DATA IS TOTALLY UNTRUSTWORTHY
21 BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY- HAVE FUN :)
